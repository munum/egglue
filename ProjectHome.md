# Egglue Semantic CAPTCHA #

Egglue Semantic CAPTCHA generates text CAPTCHA challenges for protecting websites from automated spam. Unlike conventional CAPTCHA, all challenges require only basic intuitive abilities to solve. The use of plain texts rather than images improves accessibility.

Below are examples of image CAPTCHAs (left) and Egglue Semantic CAPTCHA (right):

In the current Beta, visitors are presented with two meaningful sentences as plain texts, each missing one verb. Visitors are asked to type in the missing verbs so that the sentences make intuitive sense. An example challenge is:

`Speakers can ______ sound.`

A correct answer is `play`. Other correct answers include `amplify`, `produce`, `control` and others, as intuition suggests. Visitors are free to type in any verb as long as the completed sentences make intuitive sense. The CAPTCHA verification mechanism tries to accept **all** intuitively relevant solutions.
